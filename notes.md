# Notes / update

Still need the following:

* fix the paths in all the soy files so they are relative to the compiled JS and not the injected HTML. Open an issue looking for help [relative paths to assests](https://github.com/google/closure-templates/issues/200)
* compile and merge the bilingual soy files to the language pages
* concatinate the js files and the compiled soy files
* uglify / minify files
* Setup git [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for sample pages
